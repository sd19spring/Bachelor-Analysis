# Bachelor Analysis 
In this project you will use a Twitter API to scrap Twitter for tweets relating to the Bachelor, a reality television series on ABC. The project will gather tweets from #bachelor, @BachelorABC, and @bachelorburnbk. Once all the tweets are gathered, you will determine the top n words the given set of tweets.

## Getting Started

These instructions will allow you to run and test the project on your local machine.

### Required Packages

To run this project and interact with the code, you will need to install tweepy, string and pandas. Use the following code to install the packages.

`pip install tweepy`

`pip install string`

`pip install pandas`

### Required Files

For the code to run properly you will need to have a file that hosts your Twitter API credentials. Name this file config.py, as it is called in the main code.
